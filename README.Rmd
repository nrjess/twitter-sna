This GitHub repository is intended to create social network datasets based on 
data pulled from Twitter and provide some useful tools for analysis.


## Obtain the Repository from GitHub
If you use Git (Torvalds et al., 2022) and have a GitHub account, either clone
or fork and clone the repository to your computer using the usual Git commands
(Bryan, 2018; Bryan et al., n.d., Chapter 16). We suggest the method shown in 
[Section 16.2.2](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html#rstudio-ide-1).

Otherwise, manually download a ZIP file from https://github.com/nrjess/twitter-sna 
and unzip its contents to a folder. Either way, the files should end up in a folder 
called `twitter-sna` on your computer. That folder is your local copy of the repository.

Note that the code uses relative rather than absolute folder path and
file name references. Moving or renaming subfolders and/or files may cause
problems. We have tested it only with the folder structure and file naming used
in the primary repository on GitHub.


## Understanding the Repository Structure and Contents
The structure for this repository is shown in the outline below, where folder names 
and file names are `highlighted like this` and comments are in normal text.
The repository is set up as an 
[RStudio project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects). 

* `twitter-sna`: This is the root folder for the repository.
    * [`data`](https://github.com/nrjess/twitter-sna/tree/main/data): This 
    folder is where the data files produced by our scripts will be stored.
        * `Placeholder.text` This text file is just present to ensure that the
              `data` subfolder will be created when you clone the repository 
              or extract files from ZIP file copy of the repository obtained 
              from GitHub.
    * [`scripts`](https://github.com/nrjess/twitter-sna/tree/main/scripts): This 
    folder is where you can find the key files you will need to use if you want 
    to run these analyses on your own computer.
        * [`pull_tweets.RMD`](https://nrjess.github.io/twitter-sna/scripts/pull_tweets) 
        This script creates a user-defined query, pulls 
        data from Twitter, and saves the data to the user's local repository.
        * [`create_social_network_data.RMD`](https://nrjess.github.io/twitter-sna/scripts/create_social_network_data) 
        This script restructures tweet data 
        into a format that is useful for social network analysis (edgelists and 
        nodelists).
        * `sentiment_analysis.RMD` This script codes tweets for sentiment. This 
        example codes for positive and negative sentiments but tweets can be 
        coded in many other ways.
        * `keyword_coding.RMD` This script codes tweets for keyword use. 
        but tweets can be coded in many other ways.        
        * `dynamic_visualizations.RMD` This script creates a dynamic visualization 
        that shows the changes in the network over time.
        * `path_visualizations.RMD` This script creates a visualizations of paths 
        to explore the influence of individuals in a dynamic network.
        * `influence_model.RMD` This script runs an influence model.
        * `selection_model.RMD` This script runs a selection model.
    * `.gitignore`: This file tells Git what files to ignore and omit from 
      synchronizing with the main repository on GitHub. 
    * `LICENSE`: This file contains the terms of the license that applies to all 
      source code in this repository.
    * `README.md`: This file is obtained by knitting the `README.Rmd` file and 
      is used by GitHub to display information about the repository. In R Studio, 
      you can read the formatted version by opening the file and clicking the Preview 
      button.
    * `README.Rmd`: This file gives an introduction to the repository. Knitting it 
      produces the `README.md` file and opens the preview automatically. 
    * `twitter-sna.Rproj`: This is an RStudio project file. It contains some 
      settings for working with the project in that software.

This diagram shows the sequence that scripts should be run to ensure that the required inputs have been created.

## Install R Packages from CRAN
Scripts in this repository depend on having a number of R packages 
installed. Those packages are available from CRAN and can be installed by 
running the following code in the R console. 

```r 
install.packages(pkgs = c("tidyverse", "academictwitteR", "rtweet", "tidytags",
                          "textdata", "lubridate", "ergm", "networkD3", 
                          "linkcomm", "igraph", "here", "knitr", "rmarkdown", 
                          "bookdown"))
```

```{r install-pkgs-from-CRAN, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(pkgs = c("tidyverse", "academictwitteR", "rtweet", "tidytags",
                          "textdata", "lubridate", "ergm", "networkD3", 
                          "linkcomm", "igraph", "here", "knitr", "rmarkdown", 
                          "bookdown"))
```


## Access to Twitter Data
To pull data from Twitter using the method in this repository, one must have a 
Twitter developer account with a project that has Basic (or higher) level access. 
To set up such a project, follow this link and set up a project with the API access
level that is appropriate for your project: [Getting Started](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api). 


### Storing your Twitter access tokens

It is not safe to hard code your bearer token in your R script or have your 
bearer token in your command history.

Running the code below opens the .Renviron file. Add a line in the file, following 
the format: TWITTER_BEARER=YOURBEARERTOKENHERE, replacing YOURBEARERTOKENHERE with your actual bearer token retrieved from the [Twitter developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).


```{r store-bearer-token, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Save the changes to .Renviron and close the file. Go to Session and Restart R.

Now you will have a system environment variable in memory that contains your 
bearer token. You can retrieve it as needed later using the following command:
Sys.getenv("TWITTER_BEARER"). This should not be printed 

```{r retrieve-bearer-token, eval = FALSE}
Sys.getenv("TWITTER_BEARER")
```


## Software Information
We use R Markdown to enhance reproducibility because it provides excellent 
support for generating dynamic reports (Mair, 2016). Knitting the source R 
Markdown script *`r knitr:::current_input()`* generates this Markdown file.
Knitting our other R Markdown scripts from this repository generates HTML output 
files containing explanatory text, R code, plus R output (both text and graphics).
